        <h3>Quizify is an intuitive web app designed to help educators streamline the quiz creation process by automatically
             generating quiz questions from uploaded lesson plans. Teachers can easily upload lesson plan files in various formats
            like .txt, .docx, or .pdf, and the app processes this content to create a set of multiple-choice questions.
            This eliminates the need for educators to manually craft quizzes, saving time and effort while ensuring the quiz content
            is relevant to the lesson material.

            Once the quiz is generated, users can answer the multiple-choice questions, with each option accompanied by a radio button.
            After completing the quiz, the app provides instant feedback by marking correct answers in green and incorrect answers with
            a red strike-through. This immediate feedback helps learners understand their mistakes and reinforces the material. Users can
            also track their scores and view their grade percentage, giving them a clear understanding of their performance.</h3>
